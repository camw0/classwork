C# code &amp; notes.

### Installation
To download and run any of the following projects, simply:

cd classwork
cd [any_of_the_projects]
dotnet run # Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed, >5.x
```

### Notes
- Projects are typically created with .NET 7.0. If you need to change this to suit your installed .NET version, change <TargetFramework /> to netx.0 instead of net7.0.
- If you happen to stumble across this and think that the code could be improved, let me know or make a PR to this branch (`dev`).
- This code is maintained and written under the MIT license, which can be found at `./LICENSE`.
